            <h2>First Tab</h2>
            <p>I told my code to run, but it decided to take a coffee
                break instead. Now I’m left staring at an endless loop 
                of errors while it relaxes. I guess even algorithms need their downtime.

            <h2>Second Tab</h2>
            <p>Debugging is like being a detective, except 
                you're the one who committed the crime. I keep searching 
                for clues, but it turns out I forgot to add a semicolon. 
                I’ve been chasing my own coding mistakes like a cat chasing its tail.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Third Tab</h2>
            <p>My code is like a toddler: it doesn't 
                always do what I want, throws tantrums in the form of bugs, 
                and occasionally runs off into infinite loops. I try to reason with 
                it, but it just stares back blankly. Maybe if I bribe it with cookies, it’ll finally work.

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Fourth Tab</h2>
            <p>I built an AI to solve all my coding problems, but now 
                it just complains about my syntax. It refuses to help unless 
                I ask nicely with proper indentation. Apparently, I’ve created the 
                world’s first passive-aggressive robot.
